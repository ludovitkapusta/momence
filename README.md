2. Parses the downloaded data and clearly displays it to the user in the UI.

3. Add a simple form, into which the customer can enter an amount in CZK and select a currency, and after clicking a button sees the amount entered in CZK converted into the selected currency.

4. Commit your code throughout your work and upload the resulting codebase into a Github repo.

5. Tech stack: React (+Hooks), TypeScript, Styled Components, React Query.

Overall: Keep the code simple and the UI nice and easy to use for the user.
